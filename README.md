## Project Case Study 

QA Cinemas is an industry-recognised cinema chain that has been in the cinema and film business for over 20 years after being founded in 2004. The cinemas specialize in both new releases and special showings of classics films from the 60’s until the 90’s and has seen large success in the Northwest of England. The business plan on branching out nationally within the next coming years, but they wish to ensure that their online presence has further investment prior to expansion; they would like their brand to be known and visited. 

Currently, the online presence of QA Cinemas relies entirely on social media-driven pages that are purely for promotion and marketing. However, with the lack of dedicated social media team, their socials have been cast to the wayside and subsequently ignored for the last 7-8 months. Due to this, they have seen a downtick in interest, especially on screenings for the classic film showing they host.
Before QA Cinemas re-launch their social media strategy, they have decided that they wish to foray into the online booking world, with a custom website for their business to be developed showcasing who they are and what they do, their screenings and opening times, and of course, the ability to book tickets online. 

QA Cinemas had a previous consultation with a business transformation group that suggested that a website for online booking was a key method of growth within region and has suggested the prioritisation of this project over all other business endeavours. This means that their other areas of expansion, such as the opening of a new café and indoor arcade, have paused. 
The previous consultants also mentioned the need of DevOps within the infrastructure of this site; the ability to quickly automate and roll out new versions of a tested application for changes that need to be made. Whilst QA Cinemas don’t fully understand the technical aspects of this, they have had the benefits of automated builds and containers explained to them and are very keen to have this implemented alongside the site.
 


## Installation

These are the basic installations statements need to connect to the group repoistory and to successfully launch the webpage. 
This is assuming that all members of the group have been invited as contributors to the Github repoistory. 
As this project will be utlising feature branches, git pull is a command that will need to be used regularly to ensure that each group members local machine is up to date with the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesbryer/ams-group-project
cd ams-group-project
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 create.py
python3 app.py
git pull

```
