# ams-group-project
AMS group project repo for Team Metaelectric Space Llamas

## Installation

These are the basic installations statements need to connect to the group repoistory and to successfully launch the webpage. 
This is assuming that all members of the group have been invited as contributors to the Github repoistory. 
As this project will be utlising feature branches, git pull is a command that will need to be used regularly to ensure that each group members local machine is up to date with the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesbryer/ams-group-project
cd ams-group-project
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 create.py
python3 app.py
git pull

```
